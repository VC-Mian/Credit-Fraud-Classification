# Credit-Fraud-Classification

I used kaggle dataset for this project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022/data

The models used were Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. This project was to compare and contrast the accuracy of these models when classifiying which data was fraud and how I could improve them.
